CryEngine.Proxy
===============
Frontend GUI Manager for CryTek's CryEngine 3 
<p>
<b>Requirements:</b>
- CryEngine 3.4.0. or current build
- Visual Studio 2010 or higher for source compile
- Administrator Rights
- Windows Vista SP2 or higher

<b>Usage</b> 
- Copy "Proxy.exe" to your "CryEngine/Tools" folder

<b>License / Notes:</b>
I'm a freshman at Wright State University looking to be a Tools Engineer/ Technical Artist, pursuing a BS in 
Computer Science. You are free to use and modify the source code in any free or commercial application, all I ask 
is that you keep my name in the source files (and if you are an AAA studio, let me know about it! gordon.74(at)wright.edu).

By some small chance that a GitHub employee is reading this, please have Ctrl+S save the readme, and not the entire webpage. 
It's really a pain :)
